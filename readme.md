# JWT Authentication Template - Protected Routes

This is a template for JWT authentication in a Node.js application with protected routes. It includes middleware to verify the JWT token before granting access to protected resources.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd jwt-authentication-template
```

2. Install the required modules using npm:

```bash
npm install express jsonwebtoken
```

## Usage

1. Start the server:

```bash
node index.js
```

2. Send a GET request to `/protected` with the following request header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
```

3. The server will respond with a success message if the token is valid and the user has access to the protected route.

## Customization

You can customize this template to handle different user roles, or extend the middleware for additional checks (e.g., token expiration).
